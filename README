This is a C implementation of the popular game Tetris.

Requirements: GCC, Ncurses (if using the terminal version, incomplete), SDL and SDL TTF library (if using the graphical version, recommended), libfreetype.

To get these on ubuntu, use the following command:

sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libfreetype6-dev

Once you have these libraries, simply type "make" in the tetris directory.

To play, run either the tetris_sdl or tetris_ncurses executables.

Controls:

Left, Right, and Down Arrows: Move piece
Up Arrow: Rotate piece
Space: Drop piece 
Q: Quit
